Rainbows and unicorns. And now there is a fucking Pony. lol 

Rainbows are colorful.
They make the whole day seem so wonderful.
I feel like smoking sativa, but that strain is too powerful.
It's 4:20pm lemme meet up with Habakkuk.

Have a look,
A tall black man with a really big book.
"what might he be reading?"
Ich wei√ü nicht eigentlich,
Vielleicht konnte es was to cook.

fin.

Unicorns are colorful
They have a pointy sharp horn,
That is shaped like a corn

 <<<<<<< ponies
Ponies are like unicorns
They are small and pretty.
When i am on top of 'em, 
I begin to feel giddy.

Im Batman or am I
